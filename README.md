## 🧠 Overview & Model

This project demonstrates how advertising budgets affect sales using **Multiple Linear Regression**, trained via the **Normal Equation** (closed-form solution).  

The model predicts **Sales** as a linear combination of advertising budgets:

\[
\hat{y} = \theta_0 + \theta_1 x_1 + \theta_2 x_2 + \theta_3 x_3
\]

Where:  
- \( \hat{y} \) = Predicted Sales  
- \( x_1 \) = TV advertising spend  
- \( x_2 \) = Radio advertising spend  
- \( x_3 \) = Newspaper advertising spend  
- \( \theta_0 \) = Bias / Intercept  
- \( \theta_1, \theta_2, \theta_3 \) = Model coefficients

### 🔢 Normal Equation (Closed-form Solution)

The optimal coefficients \( \boldsymbol{\theta} \) are computed as:

\[
\boldsymbol{\theta} = (X^\top X)^{-1} X^\top \mathbf{y}
\]

Where:  
- \( X \) = Feature matrix (with a column of ones for the intercept)  
- \( \mathbf{y} \) = Target vector (Sales)  
- \( X^\top \) = Transpose of the feature matrix  

The predicted sales vector \( \hat{\mathbf{y}} \) is obtained as the **dot product** of the feature matrix and the coefficients:

\[
\hat{\mathbf{y}} = X \cdot \boldsymbol{\theta}
\]

This shows how each feature contributes linearly to the predicted sales.
